# StaticArtWithCanvasNode
## Instructions:
Create an art app similar to the Painter app in Section 13.3 that allows you to draw shapes by clicking and dragging the mouse in a Canvas. Include options for:

selecting the shape to drawâ€”line, rectangle, or oval.
changing the line color and line thickness.
specifying the fill color for rectangles and ovals.
Provide red, green, and blue sliders that allow you to select the RGBA color for the line or fill. Include a color swatch below the three sliders so that as you move each slider, the color swatch shows you the current drawing color. Also include options that allows you to turn the cursor into an eraser and to clear the entire drawing.
